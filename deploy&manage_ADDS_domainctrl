Powershell
---------
- much more powerful command line environment than what we had prior to that, 
which was just called Command Prompt, which was originally DOS and Microsoft.
- you can really speed up the process of server administration, client administration, 
cloud administration
- you can write scripts, you can automate things.

So for example, if I wanted to see what services are running on this 
machine right now, I could type
# get-service

Now, before I hit enter, I also want to point out that PowerShell supports what's called 
IntelliSense which means that it can try to detect what it is you're typing.
And I can tab through just continuously hit tab until I find the command I'm looking for.

# get-service  >>>
And you're going to be able to see the different services that are running  
right now on the machine

Uh, now if I want to modify one of those services, I can change the verb, right.
So for example, there is a service right now called the Winrm service, which is a pretty important
service for PowerShell because this is what is known as Windows Remote Management.
This is actually what PowerShell uses when it wants to remote into another machine, actually that service.
It's more important for that service to be running on the destination machine you're connecting into
than the source machine.

But notice that that service is running right now.
So let's say I wanted to stop the service right now.

# stop-service -Name "winrm"

I'm going to use a command called to get more info about the command
Get-help stop-service

And just like that the Winterim service now should be stopped.

# start-service -Name "winrm"

see the processes running on windows
# get-process 

If I wanted to see what the 5 newest event logs are doing in windows  
# get-eventlog -LogName System -Newest 5

So what I can do is I can change the formatting with PowerShell, 
I can use what's known as the pipe command.
And so piping is going to take the the output from one command.
And it's going to attach it to the input of another command.

# get-eventlog -LogName System -Newest 5 | format-list
So right now this is formatted as a list after the specification

output redirection
# get-eventlog -LogName System -Newest 5 | format-list | out-file C:\log.txt

So the other thing about PowerShell, sometimes the trick to PowerShell is
just figuring out what command you're looking for that you, you're trying to perform.
Um, so for example, let's say I'm trying to perform a command that's got 
the word net in it and I can't remember the command.
So what I can do is I can type get- command, you can hit enter.
And then from there you're going to see every single commandlet that's 
in memory right now.

So let me show you how we can narrow down the command.
So let's say I'm trying to find a command that has the word net.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a wildcard.

# get-command -name *net*

there's every command that has the word net 
And we're going to put the word reset in there.

# get-command -name *net* -verb reset

So the other thing about, uh, about working with PowerShell is that 
PowerShell uses these things called modules.
Modules load more commands in memory.

You got to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of commands

Show the current modules that are stored in in memor:
# Get-Module

So if I am uh, if I am wanting to run certain commands, I need to have the 
modules loaded in memory, for example, Active Directory.

# import-module -name activedirectory

So Microsoft has this thing called the PowerShell gallery.
We can install scripts:
# install-script -name get-windowsautopilotinfo
It's going to grab something called the device information off a machine, 
the hardware ID of your computer.

So to download scripts it's going to create a path variable.
The path variable is going to be the place where scripts are stored.
So it's going to go ahead and create that that location on your hard drive 
to store scripts so that it can run scripts.
Um, so from there it's going to ask you if you want to install NuGet.

NuGet is the software that's going to let you download scripts from the 
internet. So we're just going to go ahead and say yes to that.
The PowerShell gallery is an untrusted repository.
Oddly enough, Microsoft owns the repository, but it's an untrusted repository.
And the reason it's an untrusted repository is because it's a community repository.
It's not just, just Microsoft people that that upload scripts there.

the community, other people can upload scripts as well, although 
they do have good moderators that generally make sure there's nothing bad 
that gets uploaded.

The script should be available.
# get-windowsautopilotinfo.ps1
===================================================================
Domains, trees and forests
-------------------------
every single Active Directory domain must be part of a forest.
There is no way possible for a domain to not be part of a domain, to not be part of a forest.

a group of domains make up a tree, and then a group of trees to make a forest
With this this single triangle here, single triangle is going to represent, uh, my exam lab practice
The company is just starting up, it's a single domain.
So the question now would be why would you move into having multiple domains.

Uh, one reason would be um, administrative purposes because your company is spread out through large
amounts of geographical locations.
For example, my exam lab practice comm, part of my company might be based in the United States.
Maybe that's where the company got started and the company is expanding and growing.

But when you do that, when it becomes what's known as a child domain, because it's going to be underneath
this exam lab practice name, it's going to be called UK dot exam lab practice.com.

They'll have these lines here that are going to represent what are known as trust relationships.
Trust relationships allow our domains to share resources together.
These domains here can all exchange and share resources.

We have domain admins, exam lab practice com that can only control exam lab practice com although we
can have what are called enterprise administrators that can control the whole thing okay.
Child domains can even have other child domains.

The schema is part of the Active Directory database that makes up all of the different objects, all
the different attributes.
These are the object templates and attributes and all of that.
But basically this involves the actual database itself.

Now the other thing that that, uh, domains that are part of the same forest will share is they'll
share this thing called the global catalog.
The global catalog is a part of the Active Directory database that if you're part of the same forest,
you share all the global catalog.
And this is part of what allows domains to search for objects in different domains.

So for example, if if I'm in Scotland and I'm trying to look up somebody's user information over in
Australia, I could do that, especially if I needed their contact information or something
like that, because of this thing called the global catalog that shared across the entire forest.

The very first domain in the forest is called the root of the forest.
This is where your enterprise admins are usually created.
Enterprise admins have control over the entire forest or as domain admins.
Our user accounts that only have admin rights over just their individual domains.

=====================================================
AD partitions
------------------------
Active Directory is a database and has partitions.
partitions are used to replicate from one domain controller to the other.
But the interesting thing about that is you have to consider 
not just having multiple domain controllers inside the same domain.

So we got domain controller.

And that domain controller is um has got a database on it.

Of course that database is Active Directory.

So let me just make this big cylinder here.

And this cylinder is going to represent our Active Directory database.

Okay.

Um okay.

In the Active Directory database let's see Active directory DB.

The name of that database is actually in a file called NTDs dot edit okay.

So that's actually where your database is stored and stored inside of a file called NTDs dot edit on

your domain controller.

So the Active Directory database, uh, originally many years ago when windows 2000 came out, there

was really only about three real partitions that made up Active Directory.

Okay.

Um, and it was these first three here.

And I'll tell you what this fourth one is in just a moment okay.

So the first one is a partition called the config partition also known as the configuration partition.

All right.

Now the configuration partition.

The thing to understand about it is that this partition will replicate to every single domain controller

in the entire forest.

I don't care if you've got a single domain or you've got you've got 50 domains.

A copy of this information replicates forest wide, so it contains info about how the forest is laid

out.

All right.

Is, uh, we'll say configured.

All right.

Uh, and it replicates forest wide.

So every domain controller in the forest gets a copy of this partition.

All right.

Which also means that you don't want to somehow mess that up because you're going to mess it up for

the entire forest.

All right.

Uh, the next partition is called the schema partition.

And the schema partition, uh, is actually a partition that oops, is a partition that makes up all

of the object types and attributes for the entire forest.

Okay.

So what exactly is that?

Well, every time Active Directory goes to create something, if you're going to create a user account

or a group or an organizational unit, I don't care what it is.

Active directory uh, communicates with this partition known as the schema.

And that's how it knows how to build that object.

So when I go to create a user, it's got to go to the schema to know how to build it.

It's sort of like made up of all the templates.

Always use the analogy of it's like, imagine this big massive box in your head, and in that box says

the word schema on the front of it.

And then inside that box is a bunch of rolled up, uh, blueprints, kind of like the type of, uh,

blueprints that you might build a house with or something.

Okay.

And each one of those blueprints is labeled after an Active Directory object, like user account, group

account group policy object organizational unit.

And so when you go to create something, Active Directory goes and it pulls out that blueprint and it

knows how to build that object.

So the schema is made up of all the different objects and the attributes that go with those objects

on how to build objects.

So it doesn't store any information about the object, it doesn't store like what the user's name is

or password or any of that.

It just knows how to build the object.

Okay, that's what the, uh, the schema partition contains.

All right.

So contains all, um, object templates and attributes for building objects.

This also replicates forest wide.

So every single domain controller in the forest is going to have a replica copy of the schema.

Okay.

The third partition is called the domain partition, and the domain partition is unique for every domain.

So every domain gets their own copy of this partition.

And and they can add their own objects to it.

So this is where all of your user accounts, your passwords, your groups, your organization, organizational

units are all stored here.

And they're unique for the domain that you're, uh, you're dealing with.

So if you look back here, um, every single domain in this forest has their own unique, uh, domain

partition.

Okay?

It's not a shared partition across the forest.

They've each got their own unique portion, okay, of this partition.

All right.

And so this is where all of your different object information is, uh, is stored.

So contains all domain related.

Um.

Objects.

Object information.

For just this domain replicates only to d sees in this domain.

All right.

So it contains all domain related object information for just this domain.

And it replicates only to DCS in this domain.

So all right it does not replicate across the forest like some of these other um other ones do.

Okay.

All right, so that's important.

Now, guys, when this came out, uh, in the year 2000, that was it.

There was only three partitions that existed.

Microsoft.

Um, when server 2003 Active Directory came out, they released the ability to create, um, a fourth

partition called an application partition.

Now an application partition.

This is a custom partition, okay, that you can create and you can choose what's going to get stored

in there okay.

So you get to choose what's going to get stored inside this partition.

So if your company was doing, you know, developing applications and these applications had created

special types of objects in Active Directory, and you only wanted certain domain controllers to have

a copy of these objects.

That's what this is for it, to be honest with you, it's not really used that often nowadays.

It was something I think Microsoft really thought would take off.

It didn't really, though.

Uh, it's not used by a lot of, um, a lot of people out there, though.

It could be used if you develop custom objects that are going to be stored in Active Directory, you

wanted to pick and choose which disks are going to, uh, replicate this information.

So, um, this is a custom partition.

I could spell custom partition that you create and choose which disks get a copy of the information.

Okay.

So this is a custom partition that you create and choose which DCS get a copy of the information.

I will tell you that, uh, Active Directory nowadays does come with a couple of these that are built

in.

Uh, one is called the forest DNS zone, um, custom partition, and the other is called the domain

DNS zone custom partition.

And that gets specifically into DNS and how you want DNS to replicate, which I'm not getting into just

at the very moment.

But essentially what it means is that, um, if we're if Active Directory is hosting its own DNS, which

most people do, that you can choose to replicate your entire DNS information across the forest or just

a specific domain.

And so there's actually a couple of these that, that uh, tie to Active Directory involving DNS.

But ultimately those are your three main partitions right there.

This one is a custom one that you can create.

There is a couple of built in ones that Microsoft uh, has.

I don't really advertise this a whole lot, but but they involve DNS.

Now, the last thing that I would like to mention is that you have this thing called the Global Catalog.

The global catalog is a special job you can assign to a domain controller.

And when you do that it will replicate.

It will replicate a subset of all the objects in every domain's domain partition.

Okay.

I'm going to have to lower the font on that just a little bit so it'll all fit in there.

But let me say that again it replicates a subset of all the objects in every domain, uh, every domain's

domain partition.

That's this partition right here.

Okay.

That's this guy.

Now the global catalog, the purpose of it is so that, um, our different computers can locate objects

in those different domains.

So if I come over here, it makes it to where, uh, I could be in, say, the Scotland domain.

And I could look up a user account that exists in Australia.

The global catalog is what makes that possible.

It does not replicate all the attributes about every object.

It just represents a subset of those objects so that, um, the different machines in your domain and

forest can find each other.

This doesn't really do a whole lot if you've only got a single domain, because your domain controller

knows everybody anyway.

But if you spread out to multiple domains, uh, like I had in that other diagram, that's where the

global catalog is really going to come into play.

All right.

All right.

So hopefully that gives you guys a good understanding now of the different partitions.

This is again kind of the behind the scenes stuff of hacking happening in Active Directory.

But hopefully it helps you understand now uh, what these different partitions are used for.
