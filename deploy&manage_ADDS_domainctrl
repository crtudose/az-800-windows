Powershell
---------
- much more powerful command line environment than what we had prior to that, 
which was just called Command Prompt, which was originally DOS and Microsoft.
- you can really speed up the process of server administration, client administration, 
cloud administration
- you can write scripts, you can automate things.

So for example, if I wanted to see what services are running on this 
machine right now, I could type
# get-service

Now, before I hit enter, I also want to point out that PowerShell supports what's called 
IntelliSense which means that it can try to detect what it is you're typing.
And I can tab through just continuously hit tab until I find the command I'm looking for.

# get-service  >>>
And you're going to be able to see the different services that are running  
right now on the machine

Uh, now if I want to modify one of those services, I can change the verb, right.
So for example, there is a service right now called the Winrm service, which is a pretty important
service for PowerShell because this is what is known as Windows Remote Management.
This is actually what PowerShell uses when it wants to remote into another machine, actually that service.
It's more important for that service to be running on the destination machine you're connecting into
than the source machine.

But notice that that service is running right now.
So let's say I wanted to stop the service right now.

# stop-service winrm

I'm going to use a command called 
Get-help stop-service

And I'm going to hit enter.

And it's going to give me some help information that I can look at on how to.

To use the command.

Now, to be honest with you, I'm not a big fan of the the help documentation within PowerShell.

I prefer to just do a search on the the help.

Uh, one thing you can do some commands will let you do a dash online and it'll it'll pop the the website

up.

But not all commands support that.

Um, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to Google.

And I'm going to type stop dash service from there.

There's like 99% of the time there is a, um, there is a manual document that Microsoft has set up

on their website.

All you got to do is just do a quick Google search and you can find it.

There it is right there.

Stop dash service.

So I'm going to click on that and it's going to give me information.

It's going to tell me each one of the parameters.

It's also going to give me examples which I really really like okay.

Now I will also tell you that in some cases with PowerShell you can type dash examples and they'll have

some examples built in.

Not all commands have examples though okay.

So just be aware of that.

They they do on the help documents that are on Microsoft's website.

So I'm a huge fan of using their help documentation.

Guys.

You can always if you don't understand how to use a command, you can just about always do a search.

Find the help document and it'll give you examples on how to use it.

So if I want to stop the Winterim service, there's an example of how I can do that.

I'm going to copy that.

And then I'm going to come into PowerShell and I'll check this out.

All I got to do is just right click the window and it's going to type it in for me.

All right.

And then I'm just going to change the service name.

All right Winrm.

And just like that the Winterim service now should be stopped.

You don't get like a congratulatory message or anything.

If a lot of times with PowerShell if no, I should say no news is good news if you don't get an error.

It worked.

So now we're going to do get service.

And by the way, you can hit the up arrow on your keyboard and cycle back through your previous commands.

So there it is.

Get service.

And you'll notice that when our M is stopped.

Which also means that if I wanted to start it back up, it's probably going to be the same thing, right?

Start dash service right then dash.

Now get this.

IntelliSense also supports the parameters as well.

So I can toggle through the parameters just like that hitting tab, which is really great being able

to do that.

All right.

So the dash name is the one I want I'm going to say win or M.

And then at that point it should be started up.

And it is.

Okay, so we're in good shape.

All right.

Um, so there's lots and lots and lots of commands in PowerShell.

Like, I could type get process.

I could see the processes that are running.

All right.

If I wanted to see what the event logs are doing in windows right now, I could type git dash event

log, hit enter.

Oh, no.

There's there's some parameters that I need.

Well, again, all I got to do is just go to Google.

Right.

Type the command in there git event log hit enter.

There's the command.

All right.

Here's the help document that it's pulling up I can scroll down and I can see examples on how to use

the command.

All right.

So in my case I'm going to do something like this git event log uh log name system okay newest.

So if I do that let's just hit enter get event log log name the system log and then show me the newest

five results.

There we go.

There's the newest five results.

Now what are we looking at.

Well if we right click start here we can open up the event viewer in uh on our server.

We can expand the windows Logs and then click system.

These are the logs that we're talking about here okay.

Um, of course, it'll take a moment to load these up because there's a bunch of log entries, but once

that loads up, you'll you'll see those.

Um, now, another thing you'll notice is that it it kind of, um, uh, minimizes the information.

You don't see it all expanded out.

So what I can do is I can change the formatting with PowerShell, I can use what's known as the pipe

command, which is that little, uh, um, character right there.

It's the character above the enter key.

If you hold down shift.

Right.

And so piping is going to take the the output from one command.

And it's going to attach it to the input of another command.

So there's actually a nice little command called format dash list.

So right now this is formatted as a table.

And I can say format this as a list.

And it's going to format it as a list.

I can hit enter and it's now going to format it as a list.

So now it's going to expand it all out.

All right.

Now check this out.

I can also if I hit the up arrow I'm going to pipe it again.

And I'm going to I'm going to say out dash file to C colon slash.

And we'll just say log dot text.

And it's going to dump it to a text file.

So we'll hit enter.

We'll go to our C drive.

Now uh let me pull that up.

And there's the log.

And here it is in a text file.

All right.

So very very simplistic commands there that you can run.

You can change the log if you want like I could I could change it to security if I want or application

or whatever it's going to, it's going to put it in that file.

All right.

So the other thing about PowerShell, sometimes the trick to PowerShell is just figuring out what command

you're looking for that you, you're trying to perform.

Um, so for example, let's say I'm trying to perform a command that's got the word net in it and I

can't remember the command.

So what I can do is I can type git dash command, you can hit enter.

And then from there you're going to see every single commandlet that's in memory right now.

Uh, it's going to list them all out on your screen, which of course is very intimidating.

There's a huge list of commands.

So let me show you how we can narrow down the command.

So let's say I'm trying to find a command that has the word net net.

Somewhere in the command I can type git command.

Check this out.

Hit space dash noun okay.

And then if I just type the word net, nothing's going to happen okay.

Because there is no command where the noun is just the word net.

Okay.

So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a wildcard.

If I put a star symbol, an asterisk symbol after the word net, then um, then it would show me every

command that, that where the noun starts with the word net.

If I put the asterisk before the word net, it's going to show me every command that ends with the word

net.

If I put the asterisk at the front and the back of the word net, then it's going to show me every command

that has the word net as the noun.

So if I hit enter, there's every command that has the word net somewhere in the nail right there.

Okay.

All right, so let's say that I want to narrow down my search even more that I'm going to I'm going

to add the I'm going to hit the up arrow, hit dash verb.

And we're going to put the word reset in there.

So I'm narrowing it down.

So I know the verb has the word reset in it.

And the noun has the word net.

And look it there.

We've now narrowed this down.

And the course again, let's say that the command we were looking for was uh, maybe this command right

here reset uh.

Net adapter.

So I'm just going to right click that and I'm going to go again.

Good old Google.

Go back over to Google.

Paste the command in there.

Hit enter and look at there.

There's a help document.

So it's very important again that if you don't understand how to use a command in PowerShell you you

actually can just go in and do a quick Google search.

Here's examples on how to use the command.

All right.

And again I'm a much bigger fan of doing that than the little get help command that they've got.

Even though that command is nice.

Um, I feel like it's it's better to actually go in and look the help document up on the internet.

Okay.

All right.

So the other thing about, uh, about working with PowerShell is that PowerShell uses these things called

modules.

Okay?

Modules, uh, load more commands in memory.

You got to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of commands out there.

Okay.

And so if we type git dash module all right, you can see that these are the current modules that are

stored in in memory right now okay.

So if I am uh, if I am wanting to run certain commands, I need to have the modules loaded in memory,

for example, Active Directory.

Uh, one of the things you can do, um, once you have Active Directory loaded, is you can have the

Active Directory commands loaded into memory so that you can run those.

Okay.

So you, you can say import.

Module name active directory.

And it's now loading all the Active Directory commands into memory.

Okay.

Um, keep in mind you need to have Active Directory and all that going, but you can load those in memory.

Uh, you can also download commands from the internet as well.

So Microsoft has this thing called the PowerShell gallery.

Okay.

If I go to PowerShell gallery.com.

You'll see right here.

There's there's lots and lots and lots of commands that are out there.

Okay.

Um, so I could look up a command that I want, like, I'll just think of something off the top of my

head.

Uh, how about autopilot?

So there's a cloud technology called autopilot.

I'm not getting into it right now, but if I do a search on autopilot, here is a script for, uh,

dealing with autopilot.

It's going to grab something called the device information off a machine, the hardware ID of your computer.

So it can be used with this thing called autopilot.

So if I wanted this command, um, from the PowerShell gallery, I can click on it, and I can run this

command right here, copy it, install dash script.

All right.

So if I do that.

Let's just paste that in install script name, get Windows Autopilot.

You got to make sure you have an internet connection in order to do this.

If you don't have an internet connection, this is not going to work, but it's going to tell you okay.

So to download scripts it's going to create a path variable.

The path variable is going to be the place where scripts are stored.

Are you sure you want to do this.

Yes.

All right.

So it's going to go ahead and create that that location on your hard drive to store scripts so that

it can run scripts.

All right.

Um, so from there it's going to ask you if you want to install NuGet.

NuGet is the software that's going to let you download scripts from the internet.

So we're just going to go ahead and say yes to that.

All right.

So it's going to go ahead and install NuGet.

All right.

And then the next thing is um it's going to ask me if uh, if I'm sure I want to install the script

because it's going to be downloaded from an untrusted source.

The PowerShell gallery is an untrusted repository.

Oddly enough, Microsoft owns the repository, but it's an untrusted repository.

And the reason it's an untrusted repository is because it's a community repository.

It's not just, um, just Microsoft people that that upload scripts there.

Um, the community, other people can upload scripts as well, although they do have good moderators

that generally make sure there's nothing bad that gets uploaded.

So I'm going to go ahead and say yes to that and hit enter.

And at that point, um, that's it.

The script should be available.

I should be able to say git dash, um, windows Autopilot info dot PS1 and there you go.

There's the script.

Uh, I'm not going to try to run that script.

I'm not really explaining what that script does right now.

I just wanted to demonstrate how to download scripts off the internet.

Okay.

The PS1 is a script file.

That's what that extension is.

Okay.

All right.

Okay.

So now hopefully you have, um, you understand some fundamentals of how to use PowerShell.

Uh, this is just the basics of PowerShell.

And, um, and there's, there's other concepts to look into as well, like, uh, communicating with

the network and the ECC.

But these are just the fundamentals of PowerShell.
